### Using the network
In order to use the network you just need to run the 'main.py' script.
All the parameters of the network are defined in this file.

If you have some trouble in executing the main, or you want to use the
functions implemented in this project, you can install it going into the folder
that contains the project and typing:

>python setup.py

**N.B.: python 3.6 or superior is required**
